## Hi there, I'm Luke, a BIA Student at TripleTen

[Linkedin](www.linkedin.com/in/luke-anderson-a1a33b121)

I'm currently finisihing up my classes at TripleTen. I recently completed Tableau and now I'm on to PowerBi. I enrolled a few months ago,
and I must say I'm loving it. I had no idea there was a whole world of data ready to be discovered, and the tools to create that discovery 
have been more than fascinating.

During my leaning journey I've had to privilage to practice with real-world projects that have put my knowledge to the test. With some effort,
I've been able to take on all tasks with perfect completion. Boosting my confidence in the field of data analysis, and further cementing my 
skills in applications such as Google Sheets, SQL (SQLite, and Postgre), Tableau, and Power BI.

Some fun acts about me:
- I read a lot, hike, and love computer games.
- One of my passions is coaching. Currently I'm a water polo and wrestling coach.
- I finished a novel that I'd like to get published one day.
- I can water ski.
- Batman is my favorite super here.
- My 2025 goal is to land a job in data analysis or BIA.
